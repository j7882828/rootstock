# NSGA-III-Based Optimization of 3D Well Network Deployment in Fractured-Vuggy Carbonate Reservoirs

Optimizing three-dimensional well network deployment is pivotal for the efficient development of fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoirs, particularly in those characterized by high heterogeneity and complex connectivity. To enhance oil recovery, maximize recoverable reserves, and reduce development costs, this study introduces a multi-objective optimization method based on the NSGA-III algorithm, tailored to the unique characteristics of fractured-vuggy reservoirs.

This approach concurrently maximizes controlled and recoverable reserves while incorporating development cost constraints, forming a comprehensive three-objective optimization framework. A three-dimensional geological model of the fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir was first established through reservoir simulation. Detailed analyses of horizontal well patterns and vertical injection-production arrangements were then performed using reservoir engineering methods to quantify the effects of various well network configurations on reservoir control and utilization. The NSGA-III algorithm was subsequently employed to construct an optimization model with three objective functions: maximizing the recovery factor, maximizing recoverable reserves, and minimizing development costs. By applying non-dominated sorting and multi-objective evolutionary strategies, the NSGA-III algorithm generates a Pareto-optimal set of solutions, balancing the trade-offs among different well network deployment schemes.

To address the inherent complexities of fractured-vuggy reservoirs, the optimization model integrates critical factors such as reservoir properties, the spatial distribution of fractured-vuggy bodies, connectivity patterns, and geostress variations. By optimizing injection-production well spacing, well network density, and well types, the method ensures that well deployment maximizes recovery and reserves while minimizing drilling and operational costs. The results demonstrate that the multi-objective optimization method based on NSGA-III significantly improves development efficiency and enables dynamic adjustment of well network layouts for sustained long-term production.

The application of this method to a typical fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir resulted in a recovery factor increase of over 10%, a substantial enhancement in recoverable reserves, and a reduction in development costs by approximately 15%. These findings offer a novel technical approach and provide theoretical support for optimizing well network deployment in the development of complex reservoirs.
